# PyVox
PyVox is a voice recognition framework for python. PyVox interfaces Google servers for speech recognition processing to deliver extremely accurate results, in an intuitive, pythonic framework. Development of the PyVox voice control system began as a collaborative Code Day project developed by Ryan Beltran and Zachary King, and won top overall at the Codeday Austin Winter 2015 event. 


Update: PyVox is no longer being maintained as the libraries in use have been made open to the public through official interfaces.
